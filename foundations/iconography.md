# Iconography

We rely on Font-Awesome icons library to conduct most of our icons system. Beside, we also create a small collection of our unique icons that can only use in our system. 'Cause Font-Awesome is a huge library that can slow down our workflow performance. So we decide to spit them into 4 different library: 

* **Brand**: All branding icons from the most popular services in the world
* **Light**: The outlined icons that dominant across our system
* **Solid**: The filled icons which is supported for Light version
* **Custom**: This is our unique icons collect that we mentioned before
