# Color

Our colors system based on the Atlassian Design Guidelines, with 100% colors accessibility approved by AA Standard Contrast Ratio. To do this, we use high color contrast to helps users who are partially or completely color-blind see differences between certain colors. It creates a strong visual hierarchy and improves usability for everyone. Make sure that the combination of text and background color do not fall below the WCAG recommended threshold ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text and 3:1 for larger text.
