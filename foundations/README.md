# Foundations

## Accessibility

Products and web properties should be accessible to everyone, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, or motor impairments. Accessible design lets people of all abilities interact with, understand, and navigate our products.

Keep in mind that:

* Accessibility is about having a good understanding of our user's journeys and proactively anticipating their needs. 
* Accessible design is everyone's responsibility, from information and user experience design, through development, and on into help and support.

## Typography

Using system-ui in development but when we design, only SF Pro Text and SF Pro Display could be used due to consistency requirement and major diff from development

## Color

Our colors system based on the Atlassian Design Guidelines, with 100% colors accessibility approved by AA Standard Contrast Ratio. To do this, we use high color contrast to helps users who are partially or completely color-blind see differences between certain colors. It creates a strong visual hierarchy and improves usability for everyone. Make sure that the combination of text and background color do not fall below the WCAG recommended threshold ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text and 3:1 for larger text.

## Layout

Consistent use of a grid system provides the foundation for harmoniously and consistently positioning elements onscreen. Designing to the grid helps create an experience that facilitates understanding and brings order to the page.

## Icons

We rely on Font-Awesome icons library to conduct most of our icons system. Beside, we also create a small collection of our unique icons that can only use in our system. 'Cause Font-Awesome is a huge library that can slow down our workflow performance. So we decide to spit them into 4 different library: 

* **Brand**: All branding icons from the most popular services in the world
* **Light**: The outlined icons that dominant across our system
* **Solid**: The filled icons which is supported for Light version
* **Custom**: This is our unique icons collect that we mentioned before

## Writing Style

We speak our minds by quickly offering solutions that will be useful to our users, right now. To help them do the best work of their lives, we inspire and push teams to try new things by simplifying complex problems into easy to understand pieces. With a familiar tone, clear language and a solid knowledge of our audience, we craft messages that get teams moving in the right direction, then we get out of their way.
