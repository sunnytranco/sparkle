# Getting Started

## Overview

Sparkle is a design system that brings together UX guidelines, an HTML/CSS framework, and Vue components. Sparkle is for both designers and developers. Specialize for mobile and web as well.

Our guidelines have space for flexibility, and are continuously revised and expanded to suit changing product needs.

Sparkle's designs stem from continuous exploration and research. These designs are built into our HTML/CSS components, which can be used any web/mobile UI, regardless of the underlying JavaScript framework. Clarity also offers a set of well-designed and implemented data-bound components built on top of Vue, one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the industry.

## How To Use

We offer three approaches for utilizing Sparkle: UX, UX and UI, and Vue.
